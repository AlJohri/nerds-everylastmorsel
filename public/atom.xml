    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>EveryLastMorsel requires every resource (posts, plots, crops) to be viewed in multiple contexts: the context of a user and also independently.</p>

<p>For example, you can view a blog post independent of a user or within the context of a user. Similarly, you can view a plot independent of a user or within the context of user.</p>

<p>Rails conventions by default do not allow for this to be done in a simple an easy fashion.</p>

<p>These needs combined with a need for user vanity URLs created a pretty complicated routes.rb file which over time I&rsquo;ve uncomplicated as much as I could.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m creating this blog as a place for me to organize and catalog my thoughts as I create the Every Last Morsel website. I&rsquo;ve been writing paragraphs in Sublime and saving them to my desktop or using virutal stickies for the past few weeks so its been a huge hassle to keep track of things.</p>

<p>For anyone not familiar with Every Last Morsel, I&rsquo;ll refer you to the <a href="http://www.everylastmorsel.com">homepage</a> and stick to a technical description of what I&rsquo;m coding.</p>
