I'm creating this blog as a place for me to organize and catalog my thoughts as I create the Every Last Morsel website. I've been writing paragraphs in Sublime and saving them to my desktop or using virutal stickies for the past few weeks so its been a huge hassle to keep track of things.

For anyone not familiar with Every Last Morsel, I'll refer you to the [homepage](http://www.everylastmorsel.com) and stick to a technical description of what I'm coding.
