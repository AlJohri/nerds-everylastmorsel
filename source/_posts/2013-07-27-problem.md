EveryLastMorsel requires every resource (posts, plots, crops) to be viewed in multiple contexts: the context of a user and also independently.

For example, you can view a blog post independent of a user or within the context of a user. Similarly, you can view a plot independent of a user or within the context of user.

Rails conventions by default do not allow for this to be done in a simple an easy fashion.

These needs combined with a need for user vanity URLs created a pretty complicated routes.rb file which over time I've uncomplicated as much as I could.
